# Options Pricing MATLAB Code

This repository contains MATLAB code for various options pricing models. The following files are included:

- `BS_Float_Lookback_Call.m`: Black-Scholes model for pricing a floating lookback call option.
- `BS_UpOut_Put.m`: Black-Scholes model for pricing an up-and-out put option.
- `BS_put.m`: Black-Scholes model for pricing a vanilla put option.
- `btm_Am_Lookback_Call.m`: Binomial tree model for pricing an American lookback call option.
- `btm_Eur_Lookback_Call.m`: Binomial tree model for pricing a European lookback call option.
- `btm_UpOut_Put.m`: Binomial tree model for pricing an up-and-out put option.

## Usage

To use the code in this repository, simply download the files and run them in MATLAB. Each file contains a function that takes in the necessary inputs for the corresponding options pricing model. The inputs and outputs for each function are documented in the code.

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgements

The Black-Scholes model and binomial tree model are widely used in finance and options pricing. This code is based on these models and their associated formulas.
